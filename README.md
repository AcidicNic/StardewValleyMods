## Pelican Fiber
This is just an updated version of the original Pelican Fiber mod created by PathosChild. I loved this mod a few years back when it was being maintained, so I decided to try updating it! I didn't have to change much, I just made it work on 1.5. I might try adding the new Ginger Island shops to the menu, not sure yet.
